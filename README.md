# Machine-Learning-Projects


These are the projects on Machine Learning done during my internship training by zebo.in in associated with Verzeo.

1. Minor Project: In the dataset we will have the info for three flowers (Iris-setosa,Iris-Versicolor,Iris-virginica) about their SepalLength(in cm),SepalWidth(in cm),PetalLength(in cm),PetalWidth(in cm). We have to classify the flowers based on their dimensions.


2. Major Project: In this dataset we have the info of 'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin','BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age' of a person based on this they are classified as they have diabetes or not.
